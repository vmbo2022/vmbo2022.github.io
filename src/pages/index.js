          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            The importance of modeling the essence of enterprises on a level
            that abstracts from operational details is increasingly recognized.
            Two established enterprise modeling approaches are value modeling
            and business ontology. Business ontology provides abstract
            descriptions of enterprises in their business context, focusing on
            what is needed to create and transfer value. Value modeling is a
            business modeling approach that focuses on the value objects
            exchanged in business networks. Business ontology and value modeling
            research are conducted using instruments like UFO (Unified
            Foundational Ontology), REA (Resources, Events, Agents), the
            Business Model Canvas, the e3value toolset, VDML (Value Delivery
            Modeling Language), and the Enterprise Engineering framework
          </p>
          <p>The goal of the VMBO workshop series is two-fold:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              to bring together researchers with an interest in value modeling
              and business ontology to present and discuss the current state of
              enterprise or business modeling
            </li>
            <li>to identify key areas for further research</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Topics</h3>

          </p>

          <p>
            Accepted papers will be published with CEUR-WS.org online
            proceedings (if desired by the authors).
          </p>

          <p>
            We support the submission of VMBO papers afterward to a special
            issue of a journal, e.g., Journal of Applied Ontology (JAO) or
            Journal of Emerging Technologies in Accounting (JETA), if possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that submitted papers will be reviewed only marginally. The
            program committee will use the papers to put together a final
            program; the aim is to accommodate all relevant papers with
            sufficient quality.
